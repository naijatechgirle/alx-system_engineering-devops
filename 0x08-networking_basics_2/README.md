0x08. Networking basics #1

In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it.
It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. 
Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.

Loopback
The local loopback mechanism may be used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical network interface, 
or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. 
For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL http://localhost to display its home page.

The name localhost normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the IPv6 loopback address ::1.[1]
